# CS499Team1 - Team Awesome
Death Scene Investigation (DSI) Mobile Application

Note for the next CS499 team to work on this project: Look into UIDocument, UIDocumentBrowser, and
either NSKeyedArchiver (easier) or Core Data (a little more complicated). We did not have time to 
implement these into the application, but they would provide a much more robust means of saving 
DSI forms to device storage.
