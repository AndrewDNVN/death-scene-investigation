each "edit" file, such as "edit_case_history" needs to: 
    1) retrieve all of the previous versions associated with the case number
    2) count the previous versions
    3) IF version > 5
        delete version 1, everything moves upward
       ELSE
        insert a new entity with a version++ from latest
